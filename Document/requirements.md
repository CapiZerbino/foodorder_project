### The Context Of The Project

**Point of sale** (POS) or **point of purchase** (POP) is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed.
At the POS, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an invoice for the customer, and indicates the options for the customer to make payment.
A restaurant POS system is a system of hardware and software that work together to handle workflow and transactions for a food and beverage business.

Even before the COVID-19 crisis, POS systems had sprung up everywhere across the industry.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, restaurants are facing greater peril than ever, modern restaurant POS systems are expected to help a restaurant thrive in many ways:
* Increase sales
* Improve customers experience
* Inform owners’ business decisions
* Reduce wasted effort
* Opportunity to scale to a large business

Many of the specific benefits within these categories are interconnected.
Make more informed business decisions, and your service will likely improve.
Improve your service, and your sales will see a boost as well – a happy domino effect that makes running a better business that much easier.

POS systems provide customers with a restaurant in their pockets, with simple and indirect access to all the restaurant services anywhere, at any time, which brings huge convenience.
This raises a plus point on customers’ mentality who concerns about health during COVID-19 pandemic.
